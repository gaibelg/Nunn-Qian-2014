# Nunn-Qian-2014
Replication and critique of Nunn &amp; Qian (2014).  Joint Project with Guy Ishai.

Nunn & Qian (2014) find that wheat aid shipped from the US to developing countries increases conflicts in these countries on average. To deal with endogeneity, they use exogenous variation of US wheat production as an instrument. We find that using better controls for long-run time trends, the effect becomes statistically insignificant. In addition, using Monte Carlo simulations and arbitrary placebo data we find that a supposedly statistically significant effect on conflict patterns is not rare to find, implying that significance levels should be interpreted with caution.
